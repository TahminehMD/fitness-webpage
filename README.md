   **INTRODUCTION**:

 -- Why this **website** :

 I’ll never forget the days when I finished working at my desk and I stood up behind the desk with a sharp pain in my shoulders. After many times of experiencing this pain, I understood that it is because of my posture and I can solve my problem with small tricks.This is the real reason behind my decision to design this website: I have decided to raise people’s awareness and then offer.solutions to help their problems related to their body postures.

## Description My challenging in the Project:


* First: how to add Magnifying glass icon in search bar: 
   
   * Create the index. html with its basic structure.
   * Add the input box inside the tag.
   * Download a search icon.
   * Add a div with the image icon inside.
   * Set the proper CSS.

* Second:how to lay over three image over:

  Sometimes, you may need to position one image on top of another. This can be easily done with HTML and CSS. For that, you can use the CSS position and z-index properties.
   - Use a div tag with a class name "parent".
   - Add three img tag elements with the following class names: “image1”, “image2” and "image3".
   - Set the background image as relative so as the div knows how big it must be.
   - Set the overlay as absolute, which will be relative to the upper-left edge of the first image.

* Third: how to skew lines:

   - I got my idea(skew line) from a udemy advanced CSS course which I had been taking, but I could not use their code because they were related to Sass.
   As I did not have any clues about Sass, I used Transform to skew div tags to create parallelogram.
   i have shared the link which  helped me to find the solution below.

## what I have used :
   * google font
   * favicon 
   * scss
   * add photo 
   * wire-frame
   * animation
   * color pallet
   * iframe
   * youtube videos
   
## links

   * All the links which I used have been put into the README.md file. It  could refer to them in the future and get help from them as I have already learned a lot from those files.
