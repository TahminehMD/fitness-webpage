#### I’ll never forget the days when I finished working at my desk and I stood up behind the desk with a sharp pain in my shoulders. After many times of experiencing this pain, I understood that it is because of my posture and I can solve my problem with small tricks.This is the real reason behind my decision to design this website: I have decided to raise people’s awareness and then offer.solutions to help their problems related to their body postures.


## My  :
Paragraph:
// how  to put an icon for input tag in html
 uses a combination of CSS tricks to pull this off. First, it uses a background-image for the <input> element. Then, in order to push the cursor over, it uses padding-left.

In other words, they have these two CSS rules:

background: url(images/comment-author.gif) no-repeat scroll 7px 7px;
padding-left:30px;

// how to lay over three image over:  
 

// how to skew lines:





   1. First of all, I go to my colleagues and ask them about the reason they are not satisfied with the result of my work.
   I ask them to be honest with me and I try to remain patient, humble and confident. I listen to them carefully and them I try to
   think about what they say about me and my mistakes. I analyze the situation and try to see where I was wrong.
   Then, I work on myself and ask others who are more experienced to help me and give me tips and suggestions to improve myself.

   2.
   I got my idea from a Udemy advanced CSS course which I had been taking, but I could not use their code because
   they were related to Sass.
   As I did not have any clues about Sass, I used Transform to draw those lines.
   share the link that help me to find a solution.

   All the links which I used have been put into the Read.me file. I put them in that file so that I could refer to them
